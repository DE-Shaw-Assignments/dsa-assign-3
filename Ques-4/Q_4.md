## Question- 4 (Network Delay Time)

- **Submission Link:** [LeetCode Submission](https://leetcode.com/problems/network-delay-time/submissions/1161855157)
- **Status:** Passed all test cases
- **Time Complexity:** O(n+r) where n is number of cities and r is the number of roads and r<=n^2 so worst case time-complexity is O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of cities
- **Explanation:** Considering each node as vertex of a graph. To find the maximum time taken to reach any node from a given source node in a weighted directed graph, representing the network delay time. It utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest paths from the source node to all other nodes efficiently, handling edge cases where nodes cannot be reached by returning -1. Then return the maximum of all these shortest times to get network delay time.
