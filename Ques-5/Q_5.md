## Question- 5 (Implement Trie)

- **Submission Link:** [LeetCode Submission](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree/submissions/1161872868)
- **Status:** Passed all test cases
- _insertHelper Function_ : Recursively inserts a word into the Trie. It traverses the Trie based on characters of the word, creating new TrieNode objects as needed.
  - _Time Complexity_: O(L), where L is the length of the word being inserted.
  - _Space Complexity_: O(L), due to the recursive calls and creation of new TrieNode objects.
- _insert Function_: Invokes the insertHelper to insert a word into the Trie.
- _searchHelper Function_: Recursively searches for a word in the Trie. It traverses the Trie based on characters of the word, returning true if the word is found and false otherwise.
  - _Time Complexity_: O(L), where L is the length of the word being searched.
  - _Space Complexity_: O(L), due to the recursive calls.
- _search Function_: Invokes the searchHelper to search for a word in the Trie.
- _startsWithHelper Function_: Recursively checks if a prefix exists in the Trie. It traverses the Trie based on characters of the prefix, returning true if the prefix is found and false otherwise.
  - _Time Complexity_: O(P), where P is the length of the prefix being checked.
  - _Space Complexity_: O(P), due to the recursive calls.
- _startsWith Function_: Invokes the startsWithHelper to check if a prefix exists in the Trie.
